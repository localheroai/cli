## Getting Started 🏁

1. Sign up for a free trial at [localhero.ai](https://localhero.ai/).
2. Get your API key from [localhero.ai/api-keys](https://localhero.ai/api-keys)
3. Run the init command in your project to setup the configuration:
   ```bash
   npx @localheroai/cli init
   ```

## Commands 👏

### Initialize a Project

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli init
```

The init command helps you set up your project with LocalHero.ai. It will:
- Setup your API key if it hasn't been done already
- Detect your project type (Rails, React, or generic)
- Link to an existing LocalHero.ai project
- Configure translation paths and file patterns
- Set up GitHub Actions (optional)
- Import existing translations (optional)

This creates a `localhero.json` configuration file in your project root that stores your project settings:
- Project identifier
- Source and target languages for translation
- Translation file paths and patterns
- Ignore patterns for files to exclude

The configuration file is used by the tool to interact with your translations and the API.

### Login

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli login
```

Authenticate with the API using your API key.  This will save your API key to `.localhero_key` and add the file to .gitignore if needed.

Use this when:
- Setting up a new development environment
- Updating your API key
- Verifying your authentication status

### Translate

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli translate
```

Translating your missing keys:
- Automatically detects missing translations and sends them to the Localhero.ai translation API for translation
- Updates translation files with any new or update translations
- It's run manually or by GitHub Actions. When run as a GitHub action any new translations are automatically committed to git.

#### Options

**`--verbose`**: Enable verbose logging for the translation process.

**`--changed-only`**: Only translate keys that have changed in the current branch _[experimental]_

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli translate --changed-only
```

The command uses git to identify which keys have been added or modified in your translation files by comparing to your base branch. It then only translates those specific keys, not like the default, which finds all missing translations and translates them. 

You can customize the base branch in your `localhero.json`:

```json
{
  "translationFiles": {
    "paths": ["locales/"],
    "baseBranch": "develop"
  }
}
```


### Pull / push

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli pull
```

Pull the latest translation updates from LocalHero.ai to your local files. This command will download any new or modified translations from the service to your local files.

#### Options

**`--changed-only`**: Only pull translations for keys that changed in the current branch _[experimental]_

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli pull --changed-only
```

Uses git to identify which keys changed in your branch, then only applies translations for those specific keys. Useful for feature branches to avoid pulling unrelated translation updates and keep PRs focused.

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli push
```

Push updates from your local translation files to LocalHero.ai. This command will upload any new or modified translations from your local files to the service.

### Clone

```bash
npx @localheroai/cli clone
```

Download all translation files from LocalHero.ai to your local project directory. This command is useful when your translation files aren't checked into version control. For example when:

- Setting up a new workspace
- Fetching latest translation files during deploy

## Environment Variables ⚙️

Typically you don't need to set these. The cli will use `LOCALHERO_API_KEY` if it's set, otherwise it will check the file `.localhero_key` for a API key.

Configure the CLI behavior with these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOCALHERO_API_KEY` | Your LocalHero API key (get it at [localhero.ai/api-keys](https://localhero.ai/api-keys)) | Required |
| `LOCALHERO_API_HOST` | API host for LocalHero (you typically don't need to change this) | https://api.localhero.ai |

## GitHub Actions Integration 🤖

LocalHero.ai automatically translate your I18n files when you push changes. During the `init` command, you'll be prompted to set up GitHub Actions.

1. Add your API key to your repository secrets:
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Create a new secret named `LOCALHERO_API_KEY`
   - Add your API key as the value

2. The workflow will:
   - Run on push to pull requests
   - Check for missing translations and add new/updated translations to the repo.

🚧 **Skip translations on a PR**: Add the `skip-translation` label to any PR to skip the translation workflow. Useful when you're still working on copy changes.
