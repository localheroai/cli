CODE STYLE AND STRUCTURE
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization and adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Avoid adding new comments.
- Focus ease-of-use and understandable code and interfaces.
- Ensure there are tests for core functionality of the codebase.
- Favor named exports for functions.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.
- Optimize for performance and maintainability.
